# Churn-Rate-Analysis
I have used python and sklearn to predict the churn. As the column “Churn” which we are
trying to classify was in a boolean value, I have indexed it to 1 and 0 using Label encoder
class in SKLearn module. Next, I have dropped the blank and NA values in all the rows.
I have used 2 well known classification techniques Logistc Regression and
KNeighborsClassifier in SKLearn.
